## 10 Case Studies in Linear Regression

### Case Study 1: Predicting House Prices
**Problem:** Predict the price of a house based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location.

**Question:** How many weights would a linear regression model have for this problem if there are 5 features (including the bias term)?

**Answer:** 6 weights. 

**Explanation:** Each feature, including the bias term, is associated with a weight. So, for 5 features, there will be 5 weights.

### Case Study 2: Predicting Student Grades
**Problem:** Predict a student's final grade based on their midterm exam score, final exam score, and homework average.

**Question:** If the model's equation is: `predicted_grade = w0 + w1 * midterm_score + w2 * final_score + w3 * homework_avg`, what do the weights `w0`, `w1`, `w2`, and `w3` represent?

**Answer:**
* `w0`: Bias term, representing the baseline grade when all features are zero.
* `w1`: Weight for the midterm score, indicating the impact of the midterm score on the final grade.
* `w2`: Weight for the final exam score, indicating the impact of the final exam score on the final grade.
* `w3`: Weight for the homework average, indicating the impact of the homework average on the final grade.

### Case Study 3: Predicting Sales Revenue
**Problem:** Predict a company's sales revenue based on advertising expenditure on TV, radio, and newspaper.

**Question:** If the model's equation is: `sales_revenue = w0 + w1 * TV_ad_spend + w2 * radio_ad_spend + w3 * newspaper_ad_spend`, how can we interpret a negative weight for `newspaper_ad_spend`?

**Answer:** A negative weight for `newspaper_ad_spend` suggests that increasing the expenditure on newspaper ads is negatively correlated with sales revenue. This could indicate that newspaper ads are less effective or inefficient in driving sales compared to TV or radio ads.

### Case Study 4: Predicting Stock Prices
**Problem:** Predict the closing price of a stock based on historical prices, trading volume, and market index values.

**Question:** What is the primary challenge in using linear regression for stock price prediction, and how can it be addressed?

**Answer:** Stock prices are often influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, economic indicators, and company-specific news, which may not be linearly related to historical data. To address this, techniques like feature engineering, incorporating time-series analysis, and using more advanced models like recurrent neural networks can be employed.

### Case Study 5: Predicting Energy Consumption
**Problem:** Predict household energy consumption based on factors like temperature, humidity, and number of occupants.

**Question:** How can we handle categorical features like "number of occupants" in a linear regression model?

**Answer:** Categorical features can be encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. One-hot encoding creates binary features for each category, while label encoding assigns numerical values to categories. The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the categorical feature and the assumptions of the linear regression model.

### Case Study 6: Predicting Customer Churn
**Problem:** Predict whether a customer will churn (stop using a service) based on factors like tenure, contract duration, and monthly charges.

**Answer:** While linear regression is primarily used for continuous numerical prediction, it can be adapted to classification problems like customer churn prediction by using a threshold-based approach. The model can predict a probability of churn, and if the probability exceeds a certain threshold, the customer is classified as likely to churn. However, logistic regression is generally more suitable for classification tasks.

### Case Study 7: Predicting Crop Yield
**Problem:** Predict crop yield based on factors like rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer usage.

**Question:** How can we handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable in a linear regression model?

**Answer:** While linear regression assumes a linear relationship, non-linear relationships can be approximated by transforming features (e.g., polynomial features) or using non-linear models like polynomial regression or decision trees.

### Case Study 8: Predicting Sales of a Product
**Problem:** Predict the sales of a product based on factors like price, advertising expenditure, and seasonality.

**Question:** How can we incorporate seasonal patterns into a linear regression model?

**Answer:** Seasonal patterns can be captured by creating additional features that represent seasonal variations (e.g., sine and cosine functions for cyclical patterns). These features can then be included as predictors in the linear regression model.

### Case Study 9: Predicting Traffic Congestion
**Problem:** Predict traffic congestion levels on a highway based on factors like time of day, weather conditions, and traffic incidents.

**Question:** How can we handle missing values in the dataset for linear regression?

**Answer:** Missing values can be handled using techniques like imputation (replacing missing values with estimated values) or removing data points with missing values. The choice of technique depends on the amount of missing data and the impact of missingness on the model's performance.

### Case Study 10: Predicting Customer Satisfaction
**Problem:** Predict customer satisfaction scores based on factors like product quality, customer service, and pricing.

**Question:** How can we evaluate the performance of a linear regression model for predicting customer satisfaction?

**Answer:** Common evaluation metrics for regression models, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared, can be used to assess the model's performance. Additionally, for customer satisfaction, metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) can be considered to assess the relative error in predictions.
